**📚 Explanation** - This page explains LangFuse's sophisticated database architecture, including why it uses multiple database systems and how they work together to provide high-performance observability.
:::

LangFuse uses a sophisticated dual-database architecture designed to handle both operational data and high-volume analytics workloads efficiently. Understanding this architecture is crucial for effective deployment, troubleshooting, and performance optimization.

## Dual Database Architecture Overview

LangFuse separates concerns by using **two distinct database systems**, each optimized for different types of workloads:

## Database System Roles

### PostgreSQL: Operational Data Store

**Purpose**: Handles all operational and user management data that requires ACID transactions and relational integrity.

**Data Types Stored**:

- **User Accounts** - Authentication, profiles, permissions
- **Organizations** - Multi-tenant organization structures
- **Projects** - Project configurations and settings
- **API Keys** - Authentication tokens and access control
- **System Settings** - Application configuration and preferences

**Why PostgreSQL**:

- **ACID Compliance** - Ensures data consistency for critical user data
- **Relational Integrity** - Maintains complex relationships between users, projects, and permissions
- **Mature Ecosystem** - Well-established tooling and operational practices
- **Azure Integration** - Native Azure Database for PostgreSQL support

### ClickHouse: Analytics Data Store

**Purpose**: Handles high-volume time-series data and complex analytical queries with sub-second response times.

**Data Types Stored**:

- **Traces** - Complete execution records of AI workflows
- **Observations** - Individual steps and operations within traces
- **Scores** - Quality metrics and evaluation results
- **Analytics Aggregations** - Pre-computed statistics and metrics

**Why ClickHouse**:

- **Columnar Storage** - Optimized for analytical queries across large datasets
- **High Compression** - Reduces storage costs for time-series data
- **Parallel Processing** - Scales horizontally for complex aggregations
- **Real-time Ingestion** - Handles high-volume trace data efficiently

## ClickHouse Replication Architecture

### Replication Strategy

LangFuse deploys ClickHouse in a **3-replica configuration** to ensure high availability and data durability:

- **3 ClickHouse Pods**: `shard0-0`, `shard0-1`, `shard0-2`
- **Replication Engine**: `ReplicatedReplacingMergeTree`
- **Coordination**: ZooKeeper ensemble for distributed consensus

### ZooKeeper's Critical Role

**What ZooKeeper Does**:

- **Metadata Coordination** - Manages table schemas and replication metadata
- **Consensus Management** - Ensures all replicas agree on data operations
- **Failure Detection** - Monitors replica health and handles failovers
- **UUID Management** - Maintains unique identifiers for replication groups

**Why ZooKeeper is Essential**:

- **Split-Brain Prevention** - Prevents data inconsistencies during network partitions
- **Automatic Recovery** - Enables replicas to resynchronize after failures
- **Schema Evolution** - Coordinates schema changes across all replicas
- **Performance Optimization** - Manages query distribution and load balancing

### Replication Process

This diagram shows how data flows through the ClickHouse replication system when new trace data arrives. ZooKeeper coordinates the replication to ensure all replicas stay synchronized:

```{mermaid}

    participant App as LangFuse App
    participant CH1 as ClickHouse Replica 1
    participant CH2 as ClickHouse Replica 2
    participant CH3 as ClickHouse Replica 3
    participant ZK as ZooKeeper Ensemble
    
    App->>CH1: Insert trace data
    CH1->>ZK: Register operation
    ZK->>CH2: Notify replication needed
    ZK->>CH3: Notify replication needed
    CH2->>CH1: Fetch new data
    CH3->>CH1: Fetch new data
    CH2->>ZK: Confirm replication
    CH3->>ZK: Confirm replication
    ZK->>CH1: All replicas synchronized
```

## Database Schema Structure

### ClickHouse Schema Components

The ClickHouse database contains **13 critical tables and views** that must be properly replicated across all instances. For comprehensive details on table relationships, UI dependencies, and replication mechanics, see the [ClickHouse Replication Architecture](clickhouse-replication-architecture.qmd) guide.

#### Core Replicated Tables (6 tables)
| Table | Engine | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `traces` | ReplicatedReplacingMergeTree | Main trace records for LLM requests |
| `observations` | ReplicatedReplacingMergeTree | Nested steps/observations within traces |
| `scores` | ReplicatedReplacingMergeTree | Quality scores and evaluations |
| `blob_storage_file_log` | ReplicatedReplacingMergeTree | File storage references |
| `project_environments` | ReplicatedAggregatingMergeTree | Project environment aggregations |
| `schema_migrations` | ReplicatedMergeTree | Migration version tracking |

#### Analytics Views (3 views)
- `analytics_observations` - Hourly observation statistics
- `analytics_scores` - Hourly score statistics  
- `analytics_traces` - Hourly trace statistics

#### Materialized Views (3 views)
- `project_environments_observations_mv`
- `project_environments_scores_mv`
- `project_environments_traces_mv`

#### Event Log (1 table)
- `event_log` - Non-replicated local table for system events

::: {.callout-note}
**Table Dependencies**: Each table serves specific UI components. Missing tables cause targeted failures - for example, missing `scores` breaks the Sessions page, while missing analytics views break dashboard metrics. See the [replication architecture guide](clickhouse-replication-architecture.qmd) for complete UI impact mapping.

## Performance Characteristics

### Query Performance

**PostgreSQL Workloads**:

- **User Authentication** - Sub-millisecond response times
- **Project Management** - Simple CRUD operations
- **Configuration Queries** - Cached and optimized

**ClickHouse Workloads**:

- **Trace Queries** - Complex aggregations across millions of records
- **Analytics Dashboards** - Real-time metrics and visualizations
- **Time-Series Analysis** - Historical trend analysis

### Scaling Behavior

**PostgreSQL Scaling**:

- **Vertical Scaling** - Increase CPU/memory for higher concurrency
- **Read Replicas** - Distribute read queries across replicas
- **Connection Pooling** - Optimize connection management

**ClickHouse Scaling**:

- **Horizontal Scaling** - Add more replicas for increased query throughput
- **Sharding** - Distribute data across multiple shards (future capability)
- **Compression** - Automatic data compression reduces storage requirements
- **TTL Management** - Automatic data lifecycle management with Time To Live rules

## Operational Considerations

### Backup and Recovery

**PostgreSQL**:

- **Point-in-Time Recovery** - Azure Database for PostgreSQL automated backups
- **Cross-Region Replication** - Geographic disaster recovery
- **Schema Migrations** - Managed through application deployment

**ClickHouse**:

- **Replica Redundancy** - Data automatically replicated across 3 nodes
- **ZooKeeper Metadata** - Critical for replica coordination and recovery
- **Incremental Backups** - Efficient backup of time-series data

### Monitoring and Alerting

**Key Metrics to Monitor**:

- **PostgreSQL**: Connection count, query performance, disk usage
- **ClickHouse**: Replication lag, query latency, replica health
- **ZooKeeper**: Ensemble health, metadata consistency, leader elections

## Common Issues and Prevention

### Replication Synchronization Problems

**Symptoms**: Inconsistent data across UI refreshes, "empty traces" appearing intermittently

**Root Cause**: UUID mismatches between replicas creating isolated replication groups

**Prevention**: 

- Never delete PVCs without proper backup procedures
- Monitor replication status regularly
- Verify UUID consistency after scaling operations

### Memory Exhaustion

**Symptoms**: ZooKeeper OOM errors, cascading failures across components

**Root Cause**: Insufficient memory allocation for ZooKeeper coordination tasks

**Prevention**:

- Set appropriate memory limits for ZooKeeper pods
- Monitor memory usage trends
- Scale resources proactively
