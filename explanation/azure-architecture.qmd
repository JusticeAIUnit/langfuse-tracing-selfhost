**📚 Explanation** - This page explains the Azure infrastructure components required for a production LangFuse deployment and how they work together.
:::

Before deploying LangFuse on Azure, it's helpful to understand the main infrastructure components that work together to create a production-ready observability platform.

## Architecture Overview

The LangFuse deployment uses several key Azure services that work together:

## Core Components

### **Application Gateway**
**What it does**: Acts as the front door to your LangFuse instance, handling HTTPS traffic and providing security features.

**Why important**: Provides SSL encryption, protects against web attacks, and distributes traffic to your application.

### **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**
**What it does**: Runs the LangFuse application in containers with automatic scaling and health monitoring.

**Why important**: Ensures your application stays running, scales with demand, and handles updates without downtime.

### **PostgreSQL Database**
**What it does**: Stores operational data including user accounts, organizations, projects, API keys, and system settings.

**Why important**: Provides reliable ACID-compliant storage for critical user management data with automatic backups and high availability.

::: {.callout-note}
**Database Architecture**: LangFuse uses a dual-database architecture. PostgreSQL handles user management, while ClickHouse manages high-volume analytics data. See [Database Architecture](database-architecture.qmd) for complete details.
:::

### **DNS Zone**
**What it does**: Manages your domain name and directs traffic to your LangFuse instance.

**Why important**: Enables automatic SSL certificate validation and gives you control over your domain.

### **Key Vault**
**What it does**: Securely stores SSL certificates, database passwords, and other sensitive information.

**Why important**: Keeps secrets secure and provides centralized management of sensitive configuration.

### **Communication Services (Optional)**
**What it does**: Enables LangFuse to send emails for user invitations and password resets.

**Why important**: Required for user management features like inviting colleagues to your instance.

## How Components Work Together

1. **Users access** your LangFuse domain through their browser
2. **DNS Zone** directs them to the Application Gateway
3. **Application Gateway** handles SSL encryption and forwards requests to LangFuse
4. **LangFuse application** processes requests and stores data in PostgreSQL (user data) and ClickHouse (observability data)
5. **cert-manager** automatically manages SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt
6. **Email notifications** are sent through Communication Services when needed

## What Gets Created

When you deploy LangFuse, Terraform automatically creates:

- **1 Resource Group** containing all components
- **1 Application Gateway** for load balancing and SSL
- **1 AKS cluster** with 2-10 automatically scaling nodes
- **1 PostgreSQL database** with high availability (user management)
- **ClickHouse and ZooKeeper** deployed within AKS (traces, observations, scores)
- **1 DNS zone** for your domain
- **1 Key Vault** for secure storage
- **1 Communication Services** resource (optional, for email)

## Scaling and Performance

The architecture automatically handles varying workloads:

- **AKS nodes** scale up during high usage and down during quiet periods
- **LangFuse pods** can be scaled independently based on demand
- **PostgreSQL** provides consistent performance for user operations with automatic maintenance
- **ClickHouse** handles high-volume observability queries (traces, observations, scores) with horizontal scaling
- **Application Gateway** distributes traffic efficiently across multiple instances

## Security Features

Security is built into every layer:

- **HTTPS encryption** for all traffic
- **Web Application Firewall** protects against common attacks
- **Private networking** keeps internal components secure
- **Automatic SSL certificates** ensure always-valid security
- **Key Vault** manages all secrets securely
