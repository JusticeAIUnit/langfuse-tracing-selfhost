**📚 Explanation** - This page provides context and background to help you understand LangFuse and why it matters for AI observability.
:::

LangFuse is an open-source observability platform specifically designed for Large Language Model (LLM) applications. It provides comprehensive tracing, monitoring, and analytics capabilities that help developers understand and optimize their AI-powered systems.

## Core Capabilities

### 🔍 **Tracing & Observability**
- **Detailed Execution Traces** - See exactly how your AI workflows execute
- **Nested Span Tracking** - Monitor complex, multi-step processes
- **Real-time Monitoring** - Live visibility into application performance
- **Error Tracking** - Identify and diagnose issues quickly

### 📊 **Analytics & Insights**
- **Performance Metrics** - Latency, throughput, and success rates
- **Cost Tracking** - Monitor token usage and API costs
- **Usage Patterns** - Understand how your applications are being used
- **Quality Metrics** - Track model performance and output quality

### 🛠️ **Developer Experience**
- **Easy Integration** - Simple Python SDK with decorator-based tracing
- **Flexible Deployment** - Cloud-hosted or self-hosted options
- **Rich Dashboard** - Intuitive web interface for exploring traces
- **Open Source** - Full transparency and community-driven development

## Why LangFuse at Justice AI?

### **Regulatory Compliance**
- **Audit Trails** - Complete records of AI decision-making processes
- **Data Sovereignty** - Self-hosted deployment keeps data within MoJ infrastructure
- **Transparency** - Clear visibility into how AI systems operate

### **Operational Excellence**
- **Proactive Monitoring** - Catch issues before they impact users
- **Performance Optimization** - Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- **Cost Management** - Track and optimize AI-related expenses

### **Quality Assurance**
- **Model Behavior Analysis** - Understand how models perform across different scenarios
- **Prompt Engineering** - Iterate and improve prompts based on real usage data
- **A/B Testing** - Compare different approaches and configurations

## Common Use Cases

### **Application Development**
- **RAG Systems** - Monitor retrieval accuracy and generation quality
- **Chatbots** - Track conversation flows and response quality
- **Document Processing** - Trace multi-stage document analysis workflows
- **Decision Support** - Monitor AI-assisted decision-making processes

### **DevOps & MLOps**
- **CI/CD Integration** - Automated testing and validation of AI components
- **Model Deployment** - Monitor model performance in production

        C --> F
    end
    
    B --> C
```

LangFuse operates as a separate service that receives trace data from your applications, providing a centralized platform for monitoring and analysis while keeping your core application logic unchanged.

::: {.callout-note}
**Database Architecture**: LangFuse uses a sophisticated dual-database system - PostgreSQL for user management and ClickHouse for high-performance observability data (traces, observations, scores). Learn more in the [Database Architecture Guide](database-architecture.qmd).
