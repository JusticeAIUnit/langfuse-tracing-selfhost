# LangFuse Documentation - Diátaxis Framework Guide

This documentation follows the [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/) with four distinct content types. **Always place new content in the correct directory based on its purpose:**

## 📚 **explanation/** - Understanding-oriented
**Purpose:** Context, background knowledge, and conceptual understanding
**User need:** "I want to understand WHY and HOW this works"
**Content:** Architecture overviews, design decisions, theoretical background
**Examples:** `azure-architecture.qmd`, `database-architecture.qmd`, `observability-hierarchy.qmd`

## 🎓 **tutorials/** - Learning-oriented  
**Purpose:** Step-by-step lessons that teach through doing
**User need:** "I want to learn by building something complete"
**Content:** End-to-end walkthroughs, complete examples, skill-building exercises
**Examples:** `quickstart.qmd`, `basic.qmd`

## 🛠️ **how-to/** - Problem-oriented
**Purpose:** Practical solutions for specific tasks and challenges
**User need:** "I have a specific problem to solve right now"
**Content:** Recipes, troubleshooting guides, configuration steps
**Examples:** `python-sdk.qmd`, `azure-deployment.qmd`, `ssl-certificates.qmd`

## 📋 **reference/** - Information-oriented
**Purpose:** Technical specifications, API docs, comprehensive details
**User need:** "I need to look up specific information"
**Content:** API references, configuration options, command lists
**Note:** Directory not yet created - add when needed

## Content Placement Rules:
- **Teaching concepts?** → `explanation/`
- **Complete learning journey?** → `tutorials/`  
- **Solving specific problems?** → `how-to/`
- **Looking up facts/specs?** → `reference/`

## File Naming:
- Use kebab-case: `my-topic-name.qmd`
- Be descriptive and specific
- Group related content with prefixes when helpful

When adding new content, ask: "What is the user trying to accomplish?" Then place accordingly.
